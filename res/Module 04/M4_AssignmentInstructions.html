<h1>Module 4 Assignment: What Are You Really Saying?</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As we discovered in Module 2, conflict is everywhere and can definitely impact our relationships. Even when we are in agreement with what we say, our nonverbal communication might be giving us away.</p>
<p>In the Module 4 movie clip titled "<strong><span style="color: #b45f06;">This Is 40</span></strong>", which appears immediately below the topic titled "<span style="color: #b45f06;">The Theme</span>", we observe a couple who appear to be agreeing on some goals for the future, but their body language may be telling us something that their words are not. In addition to analyzing the movie clip, consider how nonverbal communication affects one or more of your significant relationships. View the other video clips as well.</p>
<p>You should spend approximately 6.5 hours on this assignment.</p>
